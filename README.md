# FPV-KA Community Firefox Affiliation Plugin

This is a firefox plugin to extend or replace your URL with your affiliation code.
Currently it only supports BangGood but further stores are planned.
The default value of the affiliation code is our very own which we are using for our FPV-KA Community (https://fpv-ka.de).

You do not pay any extras while using this plugin and you will not notice it. It will not reload your page twice or affact it in any other circumstances.

To test this plugin go to "about:debugging" and hit the button for loading the addon temporary. Select the "banggood-ref.js" file.
That's all. If you want to change the affiliation code to your own than go to "about:addons" or your normal addons page and take a look into the settings of this plugin.

We're planning to add this addon to the firefox store when the development is done.
